# The Windows Research Kernel A.K.A (WRK)
Is a part of the source code of the actual windows NT Kernel.
WRK is designed for academic uses and research, by no means
it can be used for commercial purposes.


# Properties

This is actually part of the windows kernel, which means
you can find the source code of many kernel-level 
NT API functions and study them.

# Uses
You can find there the full source codes of many APIs
and structures, which aren't defined in the public
API Headers. This can be used to find exploits,
make your kernel modules harder to reverse by using the
actual source of an API instead of importing by name.

Sky is the limit.

# To Be Noted
This is not nearly the full source code of the kernel,
lots of files are missing or removed.
